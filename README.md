Hi there! 

Welcome to The Bookstore!

To use this app, load "ruby config/environment.rb" in the terminal. This should open up the start page. 

From there, you will be able to navigate the application using the menus available. To select items from the menu, simply use the up and down arrows and hit enter. 

When searching for authors, titles, and genres, you can use spaces as normal.
Except in the case of searching for hyphenated words such as Non-Fiction. 
This should be entered as "Non/fiction"

Enjoy!
